table peptides

3 conditions (ectoC, endoC, HSIL), 5 samples (1-->5)

1-create average CM-->CQ (intensity HSIL)
2-create sumarry table with mass (AG), proteins (AH), gene name (AL), average intensities per condition, score (AR), unique (proteins) AO.
3-import an m/z value, calculate -1 to this m/z value (+-0.2), reduce to the first decimal ckeck if this value is there in the column "mass".
4-sort by intensity in "average HSIL", "average ecto", "average endo"
5-state in how many HSIL, ecto, endo cases it is present
